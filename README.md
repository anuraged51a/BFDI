Android app targeted to provide Retail navigation using AR Core

This application uses ARCore provided by Google for Android. 

In this project we mainly use three API's provided by ARCore :

1.Image detection: For detecting if any image in front of camera is getting matched with stored images.

2.Object placement : For placing and detecting location of augumented images in given scene

3.Motion tracking : For tracking the motion of the user in a given scenrio, for tracking user info on Map.
